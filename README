This is a Craig interpolation tool based on the TraceCheck proof checker.

TraceCheck was written by Armin Biere and is now part of his BooleForce library
(http://fmv.jku.at/booleforce/).

This algorithm is joint work with Prof. Georg Weissenbacher. It is formalized
and published in a special issue of the Journal of Automated Reasoning.

The interpolants are generated using simpaig, which is part of the AIGER
utilities (http://fmv.jku.at/aiger/).

===============================================================================
The original README of BooleForce follows.
===============================================================================

This is the 'booleforce' SAT solver.

To compile the solver, run './configure' first and then issue 'make'.  This
should build an optimized version of the solver 'booleforce' and the trace
checker 'tracecheck'.  Further options to './configure', which for instance
allow 'proof generation' or debugging, are described in the command line
option summary of configure which can be obtained by './configure -h'.  

For usage of the solver as a library consider the API described in
'booleforce.h'.   Only the library 'libbooleforce.a' needs to be linked.
